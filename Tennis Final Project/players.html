            <h3>Carlos Alcaraz</h3>
            <p><strong>Age:</strong> 22 | <strong>ATP Rank:</strong> #1 | <strong>Nationality:</strong> Spain</p>
            <p>
              Alcaraz is arguablly the best player in all of Tennis right now. Known for his speed, creativity with shot selection, and aggressive all-around game, Alcaraz plays this game of tennis with tenacious passion and energy. Alcaraz stepped up to the scene and instantly showcased his potential beating Nadal and Djokovic in the same tournament only at 19 years old. Watching this unfold at the Madrid Open in 2022 was incredible, beating two all time greats while still being a teenager really set the tone what was to come for the future with Alcaraz. And he has not dissapointed to say the least, at age 22 he is now the #1 mens tennis player in the world and has already won 6 Grand slam titles. Alcaraz has the potiential to do some very special things in the future and as an avid tennis watcher its truly been amazing to watch him progress and compete as a tennis player.

            <h3>Stan Wawrinka</h3>
            <p><strong>Age:</strong> 40 | <strong>ATP Rank:</strong> #157 | <strong>Nationality:</strong> Switzerland </p>
            <p>
             Stan The Man. Wawrinka is a little past his time now but theres no way you could forget about this man  even at the ripe age of 40. Known for his powerful one-handed backhand Wawrinka competed at the highest levels in his prime reaching a top rank of #3 and winning a total of three grand slams which was extremely impressive to do during The Big 3 Era(Rafa,Novak,Federer). Wawrinka also played with intense passion and was so effective on the tennis court due to his shot-making. He was not the most athletically gifted but what he lacked in speed and agility he most definitley made up for it with his racket especially in the big time matches, you could tell just by watching him play that he thrives with pressure and is not afraid to go for the big shot in a big moment. Wawrinka was my favorite to watch growing up, that one hand backhand was so special and seeing everything he could do on the court inspired me to keep playing tennis and work on my craft.

            <h3>Ben Shelton</h3>
            <p><strong>Age:</strong> 23 | <strong>ATP Rank:</strong> #9 | <strong>Nationality:</strong> U.S</p>
            <p>
              Ben Shelton is currently one of the best american tennis players in the world and he is just getting started. Benny is a high energy player with a massive serve that is truly extroridinary to watch. Ben Shelton is left handed which makes him slightly more difficult to play on the baseline as most players are right handed and more comftorable on the baseline exchanges with other right handed players. Ben uses all this to his advantage; daunting serve, heavy topspin forehands combined with elite athletic abilties makes him one of the most difficult players to play on all of tour. Ive been watching Ben Shelton since he was playing in college at Florida grinding the challenger tour and  I would not be suprised if I was one of his first fans. The first time I ever watched Benny I knew he was going to be special, you can just tell when someone got it like that on the court and Shelton definitley does. I am excited to see what the future brings for Mr. Benny as hes only 23 and there are many more matches that we get to watch him play!            </p>

            <h3>Sebastian Korda</h3>
            <p><strong>Age:</strong> 25 | <strong>ATP Rank:</strong> #48 | <strong> Nationality:</strong> U.S</p>
            <p>
              Sebastian Korda is also a fellow Amrican tennis player. One of the most technical tennis players I have ever watched. He plays so smooth and has such beautiful groundstrokes, especially his forehand. Sebastian Korda loks so fluid on the court its so suprising to me that he hasnt taken his game to the next level and evolve more cause talent wise he is one of the best tennis players to step on the court. Smooth technique, calm mindset, and extremely clean ball-striking from the baseline gives Korda all the tools to become one of the best in the world but you got to be able to put all the pieces together when playing at the highest level. Korda is still young and has much time to evolve and progress as a player, and I am excited to see what his future holds and if he can take it to the next level in the new year.

            <h3>Coco Gauff</h3>
            <p><strong>Age:</strong> 21 | <strong>WTA Rank:</strong> #3 | <strong>Nationality:</strong> U.S</p>
            <p>
              Coco Gauff is currently the best american womens tennis player and is no doubt one of my favorite plaers to watchon the court. Gauffs Athletic defending style combined with elite movement make her one of the most difficult opponents to play  against. Coco is a fighter and you will alwys get her best competitiveness, even when she is down she will continue to fight until the very last second. Coco has very strong counter-punching so when shes playing well its like playing against a backboard and it is not fun. Coco is known for some serve issues as she has the tendedncy to double fault more than needed but as her career has progressed she has patched up the issue and improved her serving. Coco has won 2 grand slams in her career and has many moe to come with her current progression as a tennis player.

            <h3>Beatriz Haddad Maia</h3>
            <p><strong>Age:</strong> 28 | <strong>WTA Rank:</strong> #57 | <strong>Nationality:</strong> Brazil</p>
            <p>
              Beatriz Haddad Maia is a more under the radar player that I love watching on the womens side. She is a Left-handed player that also has the passion and competivness to fight on every point. Her strenghts are on baseline exchanges and staying steady and consistent in long rallies, like I said earlier lefties are much more annoying to play against for right handed opponents. Haddad Maias highest ranking was #10 and she has alwyas been able to compete with the best womens players due to her being so agressive and consistent on the baseline she can win the big pressure points. Haddad Maias fighting passion is one of my favorite traits about her and I have witnessed some very amazing comeback efforts that show how strong her will and determination is! I cant wait to watch more of her in the future and see how she continues to progress as a tennis player.
