      <p>
        One of the most impressive moments I’ve ever  watched from Carlos Alcaraz came at the French Open, where he saved three match points in the fourth set and still found a way to stay alive and comeback and defend his Roland Garros title. Under extreme pressure, Alcaraz refused to play passively and instead trusted his athleticism and aggressive baseline game to help him buld one of the most legendar comebacks I have ever seen. His ability to stay mentally strong and fearless in those moments showed just how mature and composed he already is at such a young age. This match is agreat representation of Alcaraz’s competitive spirit and why he is one of the most exciting players to watch in tennis today.

            <p>
				Coco Gauff winning her first U.S. Open is one of the most meaningful moments I have watched in recent tennis. Gauff’s athletic defense and fight are always there, but in this run she took control of the match and showed her ability to close on a championship stage against a very worthy oponent in Sabalenka. Watching her celebrate that first major title was awesome to see.In my opinion after she won it seemed like a turning point, not just a win, but a statement that she belongs at the top of womens tennis.

        <h2>Stan Wawrinka — 2015 French Open Final vs Novak Djokovic</h2>

            <p>
              Stan Wawrinka beating Novak Djokovic in the 2015 French Open final is one of the greatest performances the sport of tennis has ever seen. Novak needed this major to complete the career grand slam of winning all four majors but Stan the man had something to say abou that. Wawrinka played the match of his life and he won by playing fearless, attacking tennis and hitting through one of the most consistent players of all time. His backhand was on another level like it always is, and he kept stepping into the court and taking the ball early that was his only pah to victory against Novak. This match shows exactly why Wawrinka was so dangerous in his prime. When he’s confident, he can out-hit anyone and deliver in the biggest matches and that is why I loved watching Wawrinka play tennis throughout my childhood.
