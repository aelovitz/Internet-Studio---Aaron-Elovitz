    <h2>Visual & Interaction Design</h2>
    <p> I chose 2040 Vegas as my prompt, as I think it is a very popular vacation destination and the rise of gambling and online betting is completelty transforming the gambling scene and how easily accessible it is for humans in America. The visual style of my website was intended to create a simple but clean feel that was easy to navigate but also matched the atmosphere of a las vegas experience. I chose <em>Poppins</em> for my headings because it fits well in my website at a larger size and helps my larger titles stand out to the audience. For my body texts, I used <em> Source Sans 3 </em>, which is just font form of sans-serif that I think fits well for my website so all readers can read everything comftorably. I also tried placing my paragraphs in the center of the page with relatively wide margins so my website can stay consistent through all pages.</p>
    <p> For my color pallette I based it on making my backgroud dark with brighter accents as I feel like this accurately reflects the feeling of being at Las Vegas at nightime. The dark blue/black background helps create contrast while the neon colors highlight important aspects in the website such as the headings and the buttons. This helps draw attention to the audience while not over doing it with overly messy or abstract design techniques. I put the wbsite sections in order so the reader naturally moves forward while visiting the website.</p>
    <p> I made the images very large so you could see clearly what is going on in my website while also being able to clearly read and see the text. I used many real Las vVegas reastraunts and enigma for my images regarding Las vegas in 2040 as it is in the future but only 15 years in the future. I feel like this would be stringer in convincing the audience to come on vacation to Las Vegas and participate in the activies I showed. Mainly every design decision from the font, to the colors, to the images and the spacing of everything was chosen to keep this website simple yet clean and enjoyable to the audience that is going through my website while staying connected to the futuristic yet familiar them of the Las Vegas Strip.'</p>
