<h1> What is the difference between structured content and semantic HTML?</h1>
<p> I am very new to all of this coding stuff but from what I saw from the article but it seems like 
structured content is how we organize information into different files like titles or 
a body text paragraph. While Seminatic HTML is how we mark up all that content on 
a webpage with effective tags that assist us. Structured content is about the content of the information itsel while 
seminatic HTML is how we present this to the web in an interesting and efficent way.</p>
<h2> How do they work together</h2>
<p> I fel like they work really well together, Structured contents pupose is to give you information that is organized and 
meaningful while semantic HTML analyzes that information clearly to label them on the web page. If the webpage is organized with all the proper components 
like the paragraphs, titles, headers all of that the seminatic html will make sure each thing is labeled properly so it can run and be displayed
smoothly through different search engines. </p>
<h3> WHy is it importaant to have structured and Seminatic HTML in your webpage. </h3>
<p> I think this answer is pretty self explanatory as having both these in your webpage is extremely important 
so its easier to read easier to edit and go back to and easier for technology and different search engines to understand
what is going on.It makes everything easier to understand and more accessible to the reader and they are very important
when creating a webpage.</p>
