<h1> Batman The best Hero <h1/>
<h2> Overview of Batman<h2/>
<p> 
Batman is known for being in movies and comic books as one of the most popular heros in 
our generation. What I loved about Batman is that he relied on his instincts, itellectual
abilities, elite physical and psychological traits along with advanced technology to fight the evil
in Gotham City.The Comic books were published by Detective Comics and the movies were published much later.

Batman is very well known for having an alter ego and it's Bruce Wayne. A rich philanthorpist that seeks
to wage ware on crime after he saw his parents get murdered when he was young. He is also known for training
extremely vigourously and it made him exercise his human abilities to the max. He adopted the feeling and
apperance of a bat to conduct fear into Gotham's underworld. Over time Batman gains many allies that he can trust
but he also uncovers many villians and enemies he must watch out for like The Joker and Catwoman while trying to 
save the city of Gotham.

Since Batman debuted in comic books he has instantly become one of the most famous and influential fictional characters
throughout the whole world. I love Batman as a character and I love the storeylines of the movies and I think he is one
of the best heroes do to Mr Wayne only using his physical human abilities and advanced technology to aid him in saving the city.
