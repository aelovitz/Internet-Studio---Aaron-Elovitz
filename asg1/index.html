	<h1>Assignment1</h1>
	<p>I learned a few things from the readings, that I never knew before learning about web design. Web 1.0 was read only and the very first stage
	of the world wide web revolution. Web 3.0 is considered the next generation of web. This web is the future of the web and will help us describe 
	the evolution and advancemtn of web usage. New technologies like Intertop have helped drastically spped up the process of browser support for web
	components like css amnd java. These two articles helped me better understand wed design and what's going on with the evolution of the world wide web.</p>
