	<h1>Assignment1</h1>
	<p>I learned a few things from the readings, that I never knew before learning about web design. Web 1.0 was read only and the very first stage
	of the world wide web revolution. Web 3.0 is considered the next generation of web. This web is the future of the web and will help us describe 
	the evolution and advancemtn of web usage. New technologies like Intertop have helped drastically spped up the process of browser support for web
	components like css amnd java. These two articles helped me better understand wed design and what's going on with the evolution of the world wide web.</p>
	<h2> Assignment 2 </h2>
	<p> I'm not sure yet what I would like to do for my semester project, there are so many good options to choose from.
	I'm thinking on making a website dedicated to someting sports related maybe regarding the game of basketball or something 
	showing the history of tennis. I'm going to think on it for sure but I am prone to creating anything that is interesting and
	that has purpose and meaning.</p>
